# Java-Concurrency
A follow along lab to cause and resolve race condition

A race condition is when multiple threads attempt to access and modify a critical section of the program. This can lead to inconsistencies or even exceptions.
The goal of this lab is to see a race condition in action and then resolve it.
Along the way, you will learn more about IntelliJ IDEA, Interfaces, Threads, and the Runnable interface.
